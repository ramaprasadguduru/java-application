Run Maven Clean and Install:
Execute the following Maven commands to clean your project and install dependencies:

mvn clean
mvn install

Build the Executable JAR:
Run the Maven package goal to build the executable JAR:

mvn package

This command will create an executable JAR file in the target directory.

Run the Executable JAR:
After the build is successful, you can run the generated JAR file using the following command:

java -jar target/jb-hello-world-maven-0.2.0.jar
Adjust the JAR filename based on the actual filename generated by Maven.

# create docker file#####

Build Steps:

Navigate to the Directory:
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where your Dockerfile is located.

Build the Docker Image:
Run the following command to build the Docker image

docker build -t your-docker-image:latest .
Replace java-applictaion with the desired image name.

Run the Docker Container Locally:
If you want to test the Docker image locally, you can run the following command:

docker run -p 8080:8080 java-application-image:latest
This will map port 8080 from the container to port 8080 on your host machine.

Push Steps:
Log in to Docker Hub:
Log in to your Docker Hub account using the following command. Replace your-username with your Docker Hub username:
docker login -u gudururamprasad
Enter your Docker Hub password when prompted.

Push the Docker Image:
Push the Docker image to Docker Hub using the following command:

docker push java-application:latest
# steps to create and deploy k8s deployement and service file #
Step 1: Apply the Deployment YAML
Save the Kubernetes Deployment YAML content in a file, for example, java-hello-world-deployment.yaml. Then, apply the deployment to your Kubernetes cluster:

kubectl apply -f java-hello-world-deployment.yaml

Step 2: Verify Deployment
Check the status of the deployment:

kubectl get deployments
This should show your deployment (java-hello-world-app) with the desired replicas and the current replicas.

Step 3: Expose the Deployment
If your application is meant to be accessed externally, you need to expose it. Create a Kubernetes Service:
kubectl expose deployment java-hello-world-app --type=NodePort --port=8080
This will expose your deployment on a NodePort, and you can access it using the Node's IP address and the allocated NodePort.

Step 4: Verify Service
Check the status of the service:

kubectl get services
This will show your service (java-hello-world-app) with the allocated NodePort.

Step 5: Access the Application
If you are using a local Kubernetes cluster (e.g., Minikube or Docker Desktop), you can use the following command to get the URL:

minikube service java-hello-world-app
Replace minikube with the appropriate tool if you are using a different local cluster manager.

If you are using a cloud-based Kubernetes cluster, you can access the application using the external IP or domain associated with your service.

Step 6: Cleanup (Optional)
If needed, you can delete the deployment and service:

kubectl delete deployment java-hello-world-app
kubectl delete service java-hello-world-app
